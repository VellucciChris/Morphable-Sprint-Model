# Morphable-Sprint-Model
This repository contains the code used to generate a morphable model of the sprinter. A PCA model was used to model the relationship between Sprint Velocity and Neuromuscular Coordination.  

Multi-Component Reconstruction was used to visualize the 3D whole-body movement patterns associated with faster sprinting velocities during the maximum velocity phase of sprinting. This was constructed by using the principal component loading vectors of 40 participants x 19232 data points to identify only the differences in technique that are associated with improved performance.
